    仰赖医药神阿波罗，阿斯克勒庇俄斯，阿克索及天地诸神为证，鄙人敬谨直誓，愿以自身能力及判断力所及，遵守此约。凡授我艺者，敬之如父母，作为终身同业伴侣，彼有急需，我接济之。视彼儿女，犹我兄弟，如欲受业，当免费并无条件传授之。凡我所知，无论口授书传，俱传之吾与吾师之子及发誓遵守此约之生徒，此外不传与他人。

    I swear by Apollo, the healer, Asclepius, Akso, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath and agreement: To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me this art; to live in common with him and, if necessary, to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art.
